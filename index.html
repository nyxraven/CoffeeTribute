      <h2>Here's a timeline of coffee</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>850</strong> - An Ethiopian herdsman named Kaldi noticing that when his goats
          were nibbling on the bright red berries of a certain tree, they became
          more energetic (jumping goats), chewed on the fruit himself. His
          exhilaration prompted him to bring the berries to a monk in a nearby
          monastery. But the monk disapproved of their use and threw them into
          the fire, from which an enticing aroma billowed, causing other monks
          to come and investigate. The roasted beans were quickly raked from the
          embers, ground up, and dissolved in hot water, yielding the world's
          first cup of coffee.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1100</strong> - Enterprising Arab traders return to their homeland, now
          modern-day Yemen, with coffee from Ethiopia. They cultivate the plant
          for the first time on plantations and create a most satisfying,
          uplifting drink by boiling the beans in water. It is called <em>"qahwa"</em> or
          <em>"that which prevents sleep"</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1453</strong> - Ottoman Turks introduce coffee to the bustling power center of
          Constantinople. They add clove, cardamom, cinnamon and anise for a
          most spicy, energizing concoction
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1475</strong> - Coffee shops were opened all around Constantinople, and
          functioned as the center of people’s gatherings, political debates,
          discussions, and critical thoughts. It became so deeply incorporated
          into the Turkish culture that a law was created that gave any woman
          the freedom to divorce her husband if he didn’t provide her with the
          necessary amount of coffee.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1511</strong> - Khair Bey, the governor of Mecca, bans coffee fearing that its
          power might promote resistance to his rule. Coffee trade is shut down
          in Constantinople. After a week-long "reign of terror", the sultan
          decides that coffee is blessed and has the governor executed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1565</strong> - Coffee was first introduced to Europe on the island of Malta,
          through Turkish Muslim slaves imprisoned by the Knights of St John.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1573</strong> - Coffee was also noted in Aleppo by the German physician
          botanist Leonhard Rauwolf, the first European to mention it, as chaube
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1580</strong> - Venetian botanist and physician Prospero Alpini imported coffee
          into the Republic of Venice from Egypt and soon coffee shops started
          opening one by one when coffee spread and became the drink of the
          intellectuals, of social gatherings, even of lovers as plates of
          chocolate and coffee were considered a romantic gift. Some
          representatives of the Catholic Church opposed coffee at its first
          introduction in Italy, believing it to be the <em>"Devil's drink"</em>, but
          Pope Clement VIII, after trying the aromatic drink himself, gave it
          his blessing, thus boosting further its commercial success and
          diffusion
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1591</strong> - Prospero Alpini became the first to publish a description of
          the coffee plant in Europe. In <em>"De Plantis Aegypti"</em> he describes the
          coffee plant and the use of its roasted seeds to create the decoction
          known as caova as follows: <i>"In the garden of the Turk, Halibei, I saw
          a tree that produces the seeds commonly known as Bon. With these
          seeds, both Egyptians and Arabs make a well-known decoction, which
          they themselves drink instead of wine, and which is sold in public
          taverns, not unlike wine in our country: they call this drink Caova.
          These seeds are exported from the abundant land of Arabia. Everyone is
          familiar with the use of Bon seeds."</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1600</strong> - Coffee is introduced to India. In those days coffee was
          exported to other parts of the world in roasted or baked form so that
          no one could grow their own and were forced to buy from the Yemenis.
          Popular Indian lore says that on a pilgrimage to Mecca in the 16th
          century Baba Budan, a revered Sufi saint from Karnataka state,
          discovered for himself the wonders of coffee. In his eagerness to grow
          coffee himself at home, he smuggled seven coffee beans out of the
          Yemeni port of Mocha which were hidden in his beard. On his return
          home, he planted the beans on the slopes of the Chandragiri Hills in
          Chikkamagaluru district, Mysore State (present day Karnataka).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1607</strong> - Captain John Smith was one of the founders the colony of
          Virginia at Jamestown and introduces coffee to North America.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1616</strong> - Pieter van den Broecke, a Dutch merchant, obtained some of the
          closely guarded coffee bushes from Mocha, Yemen. He took them back to
          Amsterdam and found a home for them in the Botanical gardens, where
          they began to thrive.
        </li>
        <li><strong>1650</strong> - England’s first recorded coffeehouse opens in Oxford.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>1657</strong> - Coffee was brought to Paris by a certain Mr. Thevenot, who had
          travelled through the East. On his return, Thevenot gave some of the
          beans to his friends, one of whom was de la Croix (the interpreter of
          King Louis XIV of France).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1658</strong> - The beans that van der Broecke acquired from Mocha forty years
          earlier adjusted well to conditions in the greenhouses at the
          Amsterdam Botanical Garden and produced numerous healthy Coffea
          arabica bushes. The Dutch first used them to begin coffee cultivation
          in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) and later in southern India. Within a few
          years, the Dutch colonies (Java in Asia, Suriname in the Americas) had
          become the main suppliers of coffee to Europe.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1669</strong> - Soleiman Agha, Ambassador from Sultan Mehmed IV, arrived in
          Paris with his entourage bringing with him a large quantity of coffee
          beans. Not only did they provide their French and European guests with
          coffee to drink, but they also donated some beans to the royal court.
          Between July 1669 and May 1670, the Ambassador managed to firmly
          establish the custom of drinking coffee among Parisians.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1673</strong> - Coffee is introduced in Germany as coffeehouses were
          established in North Sea ports: Bremen in 1673 and Hamburg in 1677.
          Initially, this new beverage was written in the English form coffee,
          but during the 1700s the Germans gradually adopted the French word
          café, then slowly changed the spelling to Kaffee, which is the present
          word
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1674</strong> - <i>"The Women's Petition Against Coffee"</i> was issued. According to
          the petition, coffee made men <i>"as unfruitful as the sandy deserts,
          from where that unhappy berry is said to be brought."</i> Women also
          raised protest against the coffeehouse itself as it <i>"provided in times
          of domestic crisis when a husband should have been attending to his
          duties at home</i>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1683</strong> - The first coffeehouse in Austria opened in Vienna after the
          Battle of Vienna, by using supplies from the spoils obtained after
          defeating the Turks. The officer who received the coffee beans, Jerzy
          Franciszek Kulczycki, a Polish military officer, opened the coffee
          house and helped popularize the custom of adding sugar and milk to the
          coffee. Melange is the typical Viennese coffee, which comes mixed with
          hot foamed milk and a glass of water.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1720</strong> - Gabriel de Clieu brought coffee seedlings to Martinique in the
          Caribbean. Those sprouts flourished and 50 years later there were
          18,680 coffee trees in Martinique enabling the spread of coffee
          cultivation to Saint-Domingue (Haiti), Mexico and other islands of the
          Caribbean.
